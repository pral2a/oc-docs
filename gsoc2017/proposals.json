Thus, we need a Getting Started Guide which explains the experimenters step by step how to use the facility, This could be similar to https://try.github.io . This guide will be augmented with novel UX components and techniques to make it simpler for users to interact with the platform for the first time.","tech":"HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)"}
,{"diff":"med","title":"OrganiCity User Profile Page","description":"OrganiCity's Account management relies on the KeyCloak Identity and Access Management. Currently, the user profile is the default profile page of the Keycloak Server which includes the username, the email, the first name and the last name. Furthermore, the list of application inside the profile is just a mess. The idea of this project is separated in two parts Develop a REST component (back-end), which can store more Organicity specific user data like the age, city, interests and the experiments a user participates, etc. It basically extends the KeyCloak, without touching the KeyCloak implementation. Based on the component developed in 1), create a beautiful user profile page (front-page), which will be an extended profile page for the users. It includes all Organicity specific user data, the experiments a user participates, etc. It will also be an interface for new users to find experiments they can participate.","tech":"Java (Backend), React (Front-end), HTML, CSS, REST"}

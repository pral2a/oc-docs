<p>SensiNact aims at helping coders working with data streams from deployed “IoT” devices without the need to complex API configuration.</p>

<p>Using SensiNact, experimenters can find Internet of Things devices which are deployed in the city, and understand the data streams that they provide. The SensiNact IDE allows the creation of applications using a scripting tool (with Code Assist functionality). These applications might set up alerts for when variables in the data streams reach certain levels, or can aggregate data from many devices, creating virtual devices which provide coarse data that might be more useful to an experiment.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>The following schema summaries the way SensiNact integrates with the OrganiCity Experimentation as a Service facility.</p>

<p>The Organicity EaaS facility collects and stores data from the federated sites (Santander, Aarhus and London, on this schema). SensiNact Gateway is connected to this platform, and is notifed when IoT devices is added, removed, or when sensed data is updated. SensiNact studio provides a graphical UI to the gateway. It ease discovering devices, and provides an editor to write applications using IoT devices.</p>
